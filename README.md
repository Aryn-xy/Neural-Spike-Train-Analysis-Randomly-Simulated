# Neural-Spike-Train-Analysis (Randomly Simulated)

This project simulates neural spike train data randomly using a Poisson process. It visualizes the spike train, calculates inter-spike intervals (ISI), and estimates the firing rate of a neuron.

## Features
- **Spike Train Simulation**: Generates random spike times based on a Poisson process.
- **ISI Histogram**: Visualizes the distribution of time intervals between spikes.
- **Firing Rate Calculation**: Estimates the firing rate based on simulated spikes.
